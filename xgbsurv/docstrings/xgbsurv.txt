    enable_categorical : bool

        .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

        .. note:: This parameter is experimental

        Experimental support for categorical data.  When enabled, cudf/pandas.DataFrame
        should be used to specify categorical data type.  Also, JSON/UBJSON
        serialization format is required.

    feature_types : FeatureTypes

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        Used for specifying feature types without constructing a dataframe. See
        :py:class:`DMatrix` for details.

    max_cat_to_onehot : Optional[int]

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

        .. note:: This parameter is experimental

        A threshold for deciding whether XGBoost should use one-hot encoding based split
        for categorical data.  When number of categories is lesser than the threshold
        then one-hot encoding is chosen, otherwise the categories will be partitioned
        into children nodes. Also, `enable_categorical` needs to be set to have
        categorical feature support. See :doc:`Categorical Data
        </tutorials/categorical>` and :ref:`cat-param` for details.

    max_cat_threshold : Optional[int]

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        .. note:: This parameter is experimental

        Maximum number of categories considered for each split. Used only by
        partition-based splits for preventing over-fitting. Also, `enable_categorical`
        needs to be set to have categorical feature support. See :doc:`Categorical Data
        </tutorials/categorical>` and :ref:`cat-param` for details.

    eval_metric : Optional[Union[str, List[str], Callable]]

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

        Metric used for monitoring the training result and early stopping.  It can be a
        string or list of strings as names of predefined metric in XGBoost (See
        doc/parameter.rst), one of the metrics in :py:mod:`sklearn.metrics`, or any other
        user defined metric that looks like `sklearn.metrics`. 
        
        For survival metric choose one of the following: 
        'breslow_loss', 'efron_loss', 'cind_loss', 'deephit_loss', 'aft_loss', 'ah_loss', 'eh_loss'.

        If custom objective is also provided, then custom metric should implement the
        corresponding reverse link function.

        Unlike the `scoring` parameter commonly used in scikit-learn, when a callable
        object is provided, it's assumed to be a cost function and by default XGBoost will
        minimize the result during early stopping.

        For advanced usage on Early stopping like directly choosing to maximize instead of
        minimize, see :py:obj:`xgboost.callback.EarlyStopping`.

        See :doc:`Custom Objective and Evaluation Metric </tutorials/custom_metric_obj>`
        for more.

        .. note::

             This parameter replaces `eval_metric` in :py:meth:`fit` method.  The old one
             receives un-transformed prediction regardless of whether custom objective is
             being used.

        .. code-block:: python

            from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
            from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
            X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)
            reg = xgb.XGBRegressor(
                tree_method="hist",
                eval_metric=mean_absolute_error,
            )
            reg.fit(X, y, eval_set=[(X, y)])

    early_stopping_rounds : Optional[int]

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0

        Activates early stopping. Validation metric needs to improve at least once in
        every **early_stopping_rounds** round(s) to continue training.  Requires at least
        one item in **eval_set** in :py:meth:`fit`.

        The method returns the model from the last iteration (not the best one).  If
        there's more than one item in **eval_set**, the last entry will be used for early
        stopping.  If there's more than one metric in **eval_metric**, the last metric
        will be used for early stopping.

        If early stopping occurs, the model will have three additional fields:
        :py:attr:`best_score`, :py:attr:`best_iteration` and
        :py:attr:`best_ntree_limit`.

        .. note::

            This parameter replaces `early_stopping_rounds` in :py:meth:`fit` method.

    callbacks : Optional[List[TrainingCallback]]
        List of callback functions that are applied at end of each iteration.
        It is possible to use predefined callbacks by using
        :ref:`Callback API <callback_api>`.

        .. note::

           States in callback are not preserved during training, which means callback
           objects can not be reused for multiple training sessions without
           reinitialization or deepcopy.

        .. code-block:: python

            for params in parameters_grid:
                # be sure to (re)initialize the callbacks before each run
                callbacks = [xgb.callback.LearningRateScheduler(custom_rates)]
                xgboost.train(params, Xy, callbacks=callbacks)

    kwargs : dict, optional
        Keyword arguments for XGBoost Booster object.  Full documentation of parameters
        can be found :doc:`here </parameter>`.
        Attempting to set a parameter via the constructor args and \*\*kwargs
        dict simultaneously will result in a TypeError.

        .. note:: \*\*kwargs unsupported by scikit-learn

            \*\*kwargs is unsupported by scikit-learn.  We do not guarantee
            that parameters passed via this argument will interact properly
            with scikit-learn.

        .. note::  Custom objective function

            A custom objective function can be provided for the ``objective``
            parameter. In this case, it should have the signature
            ``objective(y_true, y_pred) -> grad, hess``:

            y_true: array_like of shape [n_samples]
                The target values
            y_pred: array_like of shape [n_samples]
                The predicted values

            grad: array_like of shape [n_samples]
                The value of the gradient for each sample point.
            hess: array_like of shape [n_samples]
                The value of the second derivative for each sample point
